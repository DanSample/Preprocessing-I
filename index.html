      <h2>The Love of Creation</h2>
        <p>From the time I was a little boy I loved to create. Growing up in a tiny beach town in The Great Northwest was a perfect place for my little mind to run wild. From building sandcastles to treeforts I always loved the idea of designing and creating what I could picture in my mind, but wasn't in front of me....yet.     </p>
      
      <h2>The Love of Learning</h2>
        <p>Fast forward to today, no longer is it sandcastles and treeforts. I get to build websites and applications from the ground up, and falling in love with learning was the first step. Since the day I started at <a href="www.lambdaschool.com">Lambda School</a> I have been learning and working with the leading technologies in the industry. Evey new language, framework, library is a new adventure that in the end adds tools to my skillset and makes me a better developer. My Goal has always been to be the best that I can be wherever I am and with whatever I'm doing.</p>
